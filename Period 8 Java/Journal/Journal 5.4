Entry 1, May 4
Today we(Toby, Fulton, me) should be trying to discuss the basic outlines of the program we are creating,
something similar to a turn base dungeon game.

We have determined that the game will be inspired by Evoland and One Day Heroics
We will decide when to start the program tomorrow.

Entry 2, May 5th
Today I want to decide among us what language we will be using to program this dungeon-esk game of ours... maybe snap or
scratch may be easier. C++ is potentially an option as well. Once we've established the language, we can start programming 
fundamentals of this project.

We wil stick to using Java, since we've used it all year long. The basics of the program and repository have been set up,
now it's all a matter of coding....
Perhaps next time I'll actually figure out my role in this group

Entry 3, May 8th 
While I'm not doing anything, I should consider sprites/other visuals and the front end... though I have no idea how to
work half of the stuff in the front end.

I might.. just branch off to do something else. I guess a part of me knows I won't be continuing computer programming
in the near future, so an application seems to be out of the question at the moment. The hard part is considering a
final product for this symposium
