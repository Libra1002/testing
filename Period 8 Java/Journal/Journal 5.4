Entry 1, May 4
Today we(Toby, Fulton, me) should be trying to discuss the basic outlines of the program we are creating,
something similar to a turn base dungeon game.

We have determined that the game will be inspired by Evoland and One Day Heroics
We will decide when to start the program tomorrow.

Entry 2, May 5th
Today I want to decide among us what language we will be using to program this dungeon-esk game of ours... maybe snap or
scratch may be easier. C++ is potentially an option as well. Once we've established the language, we can start 
programming fundamentals of this project.

We wil stick to using Java, since we've used it all year long. The basics of the program and repository have been set up,
now it's all a matter of coding....
Perhaps next time I'll actually figure out my role in this group

Entry 3, May 8th 
While I'm not doing anything, I should consider sprites/other visuals and the front end... though I have no idea how to
work half of the stuff in the front end.

I might.. just branch off to do something else. I guess a part of me knows I won't be continuing computer programming
in the near future, so an application seems to be out of the question at the moment. The hard part is considering a
final product for this symposium

Entry 4, May 9th
Forensics and computer science... the first thing that comes to mind is data recovery, mostly for crimes. Digital 
forensics
is all about finding evidence via the internet, computers, or other electronics, said evidence is acquired via data
recovery, or hacking servers or computers to find what you might need for a case.
If talked about seperately, you can use computers to aid in forensics, for things like facial recognition or figuring out
the identity of certain pieces of evidence, but mostly it's used to track data across the various servers of the world.

What I need to figure out, and rather soon, is trying to find some kind of product that I CAN produce at the end of all 
of this.

Entry 5, May 10th
In terms of product goals, I've got 0 clues. The way I interpret forensic science is using a database and simply comparing
pieces of data with the evidence at hand until you find a match. Comparing is simple, sorting data is relatively simple, 
it's finding a product goal out of this that I need to figure out.
In terms of skill goals, since I can hardly program, I have very limited options... if any.
For some reason the hand game "Chopsticks" keeps coming to my mind. It sounds easy to program via Snap/Scratch, maybe a 
little bit too simple. Using Snap to program a few games also comes into my mind, now that I think about it. The product
goal is an arcade with different games, the skill goal could be game development. That may just be the ticket to this 
symposium. Using Snap to create something like Monopoly or Master Mind sounds a lot simpler than using java to program 
the
average game, based on what I've done all year.
On a side note, with a bit of clarification it would be much simpler to do more in-depth research of how forensic science 
works out in the field, I'm more than sure that there are many cases that involved the destruction of data, only for 
experts to eventually recover, and convict cyber criminals with it. Product goal : Paper, Skill goal : learning about
computer science in forensics? Can't quite grasp what the right words are for this.

Both ideas are tempting to me at the moment, but I should make the final decision on what to do fairly soon, and commit 
to the idea.

Entry 6, May 11
In the interest of saving time, effort, and general interest, I'll be making a paper on how computer science can be used 
in
forensics. While this is a product goal, I don't know how to put into words what the skill goal will be.

For the large majority of the 2 periods today, I spent looking up cases related to computer forensics. One of the most 
important cases is the BTK case, where a serial killer was finally arrested after police discovered evidence that he was
sending letters to the police after murdering his victims. Aside from that I'm still going to have to find other 
relations between computer science and forensics.

Entry 7, May 12th
I should probably begin putting something down on this paper, structuring it is a bottom priority because I can shift 
pieces of text around as I please relatively easily, finding what I want to put down will be slightly harder
The BTK case will be on there
the process of data recovery will be there
other uses, like facial recognition, should probably be in there
At the same time, should I be ordering this like some kind of essay? The format of an essay doesn't seem to make sense in 
this assignment, that's my gut instinct. I will most likely just go for a bullet list? randomly placed paragraphs?
Is an introduction necessary? I can only assume that most people know the basics to forensics but it may or may not still 
be necessary to have an introduction for those who live under a rock like me.

I'm hoping that this paper won't be too short, because it would be really awkward to have a short paper on this kind of
topic, and yet I still have to worry about how I'm going to do a presentation, but that will come when it's time.

Entry 8, May 15
Continue working on the paper. Will try and finish how data recovery works, about the BTK case, and possibly start on 
facial recognition. The more I think about it, the more data recovery reminds me of a certain scene from a certain game..
(MMSF3) 

Facial recognition and data recovery are done, though I probably could've gotten more done if I wasn't falling asleep 
every now and then.

Entry 9, May 16
Tracking over the internet seems like an easy concept, I may or may not choose to go in depth with it. Today I should try
and put the BTK case into this paper.

Definitely putting tracking aside, there are a lot more components to a computer/phone/other devices' IP address and 
such. After the BTK, I should consider what goes on the presentation part of this project.

Entry 10, May 17
I should start logging the case in, but there should be more examples of cases solved with computer forensics 

Next time, I should document Sharon Lopatka's case, and probably start on the presentation end of this symposium.

Entry 11, May 18
The Sharon Lopatka case, the story about how Lopatka decided to browse the internet, looking to get someone to fulfill 
her dream of.... dying to someone else. Once she found someone, she left a note to her husband telling him not to find
her, and he reported said note to the police. The police required the use of her computer to find out about her strange 
life on the internet. Under normal circumstances, the police would never be able to track her down, but the internet 
USUALLY doesn't lie... or rather people can't lie to themselves about what they post all over the internet. Police 
eventually found text messages amounting to something similar to a "900 page novel," to one Robert Glass, who was arrested
on account of first degree murder. He eventually pleaded guilty to voluntary man slaughter and second degree sexual 
exploitation.

Now that that's done, I will either work on the presentation or include tracking into the paper, just to make it longer.
The problem is demonstrating a skill, the only thing that comes to mind is demonstrating how I can connect
computer science with forensics in the field.

Entry 12, May 23
Did parts of a bibliography, may include more links if I decide to add more to this paper. In 3 weeks, there is quite a 
bit that I can do with the time.

For the sake of having nothing to do, I'm gonna try and put in data about IP addresses and all that whatnot that connects
a person to the internet

Entry 13, May 24
From my understanding, the powerpoint will be a more extensive look on one of the topics that is already on this paper....
or about something else entirely. Tracking should be the topic of said powerpoint, and with so much information about IP
addresses and how everything circulates through the internet, that shouldn't be that hard of a topic to find in depth
information about. I shall start that on the next entry.
