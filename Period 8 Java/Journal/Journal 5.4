Entry 1, May 4
Today we(Toby, Fulton, me) should be trying to discuss the basic outlines of the program we are creating,
something similar to a turn base dungeon game.

We have determined that the game will be inspired by Evoland and One Day Heroics
We will decide when to start the program tomorrow.

Entry 2, May 5th
Today I want to decide among us what language we will be using to program this dungeon-esk game of ours... maybe snap or
scratch may be easier. C++ is potentially an option as well. Once we've established the language, we can start programming 
fundamentals of this project.

We wil stick to using Java, since we've used it all year long. The basics of the program and repository have been set up,
now it's all a matter of coding....
Perhaps next time I'll actually figure out my role in this group

Entry 3, May 8th 
While I'm not doing anything, I should consider sprites/other visuals and the front end... though I have no idea how to
work half of the stuff in the front end.

I might.. just branch off to do something else. I guess a part of me knows I won't be continuing computer programming
in the near future, so an application seems to be out of the question at the moment. The hard part is considering a
final product for this symposium

Entry 4, May 9th
Forensics and computer science... the first thing that comes to mind is data recovery, mostly for crimes. Digital forensics
is all about finding evidence via the internet, computers, or other electronics, said evidence is acquired via data
recovery, or hacking servers or computers to find what you might need for a case.
If talked about seperately, you can use computers to aid in forensics, for things like facial recognition or figuring out
the identity of certain pieces of evidence, but mostly it's used to track data across the various servers of the world.

What I need to figure out, and rather soon, is trying to find some kind of product that I CAN produce at the end of all 
of this.

Entry 5, May 10th
In terms of product goals, I've got 0 clues. The way I interpret forensic science is using a database and simply comparing
pieces of data with the evidence at hand until you find a match. Comparing is simple, sorting data is relatively simple, 
it's finding a product goal out of this that I need to figure out.
In terms of skill goals, since I can hardly program, I have very limited options... if any.
For some reason the hand game "Chopsticks" keeps coming to my mind. It sounds easy to program via Snap/Scratch, maybe a 
little bit too simple. Using Snap to program a few games also comes into my mind, now that I think about it. The product
goal is an arcade with different games, the skill goal could be game development. That may just be the ticket to this 
symposium. Using Snap to create something like Monopoly or Master Mind sounds a lot simpler than using java to program the
average game, based on what I've done all year.
On a side note, with a bit of clarification it would be much simpler to do more in-depth research of how forensic science 
works out in the field, I'm more than sure that there are many cases that involved the destruction of data, only for 
experts to eventually recover, and convict cyber criminals with it. Product goal : Paper, Skill goal : learning about
computer science in forensics? Can't quite grasp what the right words are for this.

Both ideas are tempting to me at the moment, but I should make the final decision on what to do fairly soon, and commit 
to the idea.

Entry 6, May 11
In the interest of saving time, effort, and general interest, I'll be making a paper on how computer science can be used in
forensics. While this is a product goal, I don't know how to put into words what the skill goal will be.

For the large majority of the 2 periods today, I spent looking up cases related to computer forensics. One of the most 
important cases is the BTK case, where a serial killer was finally arrested after police discovered evidence that he was
sending letters to the police after murdering his victims. Aside from that I'm still going to have to find other relations
between computer science and forensics.

Entry 7, May 12th
I should probably begin putting something down on this paper, structuring it is a bottom priority because I can shift 
pieces of text around as I please relatively easily, finding what I want to put down will be slightly harder
The BTK case will be on there
the process of data recovery will be there
other uses, like facial recognition, should probably be in there
At the same time, should I be ordering this like some kind of essay? The format of an essay doesn't seem to make sense in 
this assignment, that's my gut instinct. I will most likely just go for a bullet list? randomly placed paragraphs?
Is an introduction necessary? I can only assume that most people know the basics to forensics but it may or may not still 
be necessary to have an introduction for those who live under a rock like me.

I'm hoping that this paper won't be too short, because it would be really awkward to have a short paper on this kind of
topic, and yet I still have to worry about how I'm going to do a presentation, but that will come when it's time.

Entry 8, May 15
Continue working on the paper. Will try and finish how data recovery works, about the BTK case, and possibly start on 
facial recognition. The more I think about it, the more data recovery reminds me of a certain scene from a certain game...
(MMSF3) 

Facial recognition and data recovery are done, though I probably could've gotten more done if I wasn't falling asleep 
every now and then.
