Entry 1, May 4
Today we(Toby, Fulton, me) should be trying to discuss the basic outlines of the program we are creating,
something similar to a turn base dungeon game.

We have determined that the game will be inspired by Evoland and One Day Heroics
We will decide when to start the program tomorrow.
